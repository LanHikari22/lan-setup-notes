# 1 What is this?

Welcome!

This is the central notes repository for my tooling development, diagnostics, setup, configurations, and improving open source tools!

Many great projects and ideas do not get off the ground because of friction with system integration, building, 
or just struggling to get far enough to be able to do something useful. 

Let's reduce friction!

For higher browser viewing compatibility, switch to the [webview branch](https://github.com/LanHikari22/lan-setup-notes/tree/webview).

# 3 Contributing

All contributions are welcome! 

If you have any comments or suggestions you can reach out by opening an issue ticket or emailing lanhikarixx@gmail.com.

As this is about general notes on setup and system issues, please feel free to suggest problems you would like to be solved. 

This helps me get an idea of where developers face high friction in system builds and setups and I would appreciate it a lot.

If you have a solution for a problem outlined here, you can open a PR with your own obsidian note under `contrib/` and I can review them and integrate them in.

If you find any issues on matters of performance, ergonomics, security, accuracy, practice, or related, please reach out!

One reason for making notes public is to make my creative process transparent and open to critique by others so that I can improve my process!
