### 0.1.1 role::user

When starting CoD on forced compatibility mode in steam, it just quickly reverts back to green button "Play"

### 0.1.3 Let's first discover what its Steam ID is

[Previously](Wk%2025%20000%20Steam%20says%20Game%20started%20but%20nothing%20happens.md#clair-obscur-desktop1) we found a `*.desktop` file with the ID. Here is how we find all of them:

````sh
find -L /home/lan/snap/steam/common/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/*/pfx/dosdevices/z:/proc/*/cwd/.local/share/applications/ -maxdepth 1 -type f 2>/dev/null
````

````sh
$ cat /home/lan/snap/steam/common/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/1262350/pfx/dosdevices/z:/proc/2629062/cwd/.local/share/applications/Call\ of\ Duty.desktop 
[Desktop Entry]
Name=Call of DutyÂ®
Comment=Play this game on Steam
Exec=snap run steam steam://rungameid/1938090
Icon=steam_icon_1938090
Terminal=false
Type=Application
Categories=Game;

````

OK. We know we are ID 1938090 for CoD.

Let's check `protondb`. This one was for  [Clair Obscur: Expedition 33](https://www.protondb.com/app/1903340) and this one is for [CoD](https://www.protondb.com/app/1938090)

![Pasted image 20250618095452.png](../../../../attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250618095452.png)

There they report that it's "BORKED" and unsupported.

##### 0.1.4.1.1 On the comment there by Spoon "Unsupported Anti-Cheat (Ricochet Anti-Cheat)"

They flag Kernel-Level Anti-Cheat as the issue. Labeling it "Ricochet Anti-Cheat". They say this has become standard since the 2019 reboot of the MW series and it uses elements exclusive to the windows kernel. They said the developer mentioned if someone finds a workaround they won't be punished so long as they do not interfere with the anti-cheat's functions.
