# 1 Wk 26 007 Github compatible screenshot links in Obsidian

# 2 Objective

See this link below:

It loads in obsidian.

This one too:

But not this one:

We built [[Wk 26 000 On why the rust linker is single-threaded#3.1.2 Building pixie_wrangler|PIXIE WRANGLER]] here! It's an open source rust video game about PCB Design!

Github-compatible link:

Obsidian-internal link:

We should even be able to load up gifs. This is from a super cool game [FEZ](<https://store.steampowered.com/app/224760/FEZ/>) that gives a very different game experience with a camera that interacts with the world.


The pattern is simple for the github link:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LanHikari22/lan-setup-notes/refs/heads/main/attachments/Pasted%20image%2020250624135814.png
```

We should be able to hover over a link in obsidian, and use a templater script to "upgrade it" to its github variant so that everyone sees it. If already upgraded, it remains as is.

Alternatively, we can also see if there are extensions that already do this for us.
