From [013 Change all delta-trace old format notes into note clusters without applying link fixing](../tasks/013%20Change%20all%20delta-trace%20old%20format%20notes%20into%20note%20clusters%20without%20applying%20link%20fixing.md),

* [ ] Will need to update [gh Vincenius/wwebdev-comments #3](https://github.com/Vincenius/wwebdev-comments/issues/3) since it shares a link to changing notes. Make sure the link there becomes permanent.
