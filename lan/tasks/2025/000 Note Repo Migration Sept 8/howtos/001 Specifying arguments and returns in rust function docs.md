There's some examples in ([stackoverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30009650/how-to-document-rust-function-arguments) $\to$) [rust-by-example Documentation](https://doc.rust-lang.org/beta/rust-by-example/meta/doc.html)

It seems they do not rely on the style of documenting argument by argument here but instead just write what the function does and maybe also add examples.
