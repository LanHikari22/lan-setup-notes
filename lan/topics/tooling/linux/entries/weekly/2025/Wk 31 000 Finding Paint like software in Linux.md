I already have [Pinta](https://www.pinta-project.com/) and should probably learn how to use it... But it doesn't seem as unintuitive as Windows Paint. I can't just select a region, right click, and select crop for example.

Check [[#3.1 Cropping selected region in Pinta]].

But it's not too hard, there's a button for crop, as seen in the link above.
