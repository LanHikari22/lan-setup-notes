I would like to have full control of one of my phones at least. I have...

My [Pixel 3](https://www.phonemore.com/specs/google/pixel-3/) is more outdated, from 2018. It's lagging, so it's in need of upgrade more, but it also has weaker specs.

But also unlike my [Galaxy A54](https://www.phonemore.com/specs/samsung/galaxy-a54/sm-a546eds-256gb/)  Pixel 3 is supported by [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org/).
