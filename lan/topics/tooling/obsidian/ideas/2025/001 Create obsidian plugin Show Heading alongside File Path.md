In Vscode, if you're inside some big function or class, it will still show it for you.

Notice the path name includes the class and the function  you're in, so you don't have to scroll through the outline or file. 

Make it happen in Obsidian!

Another thing, if obsidian outline actually followed with jumps, then that would make the information available. I have to go and scroll manually to find which section it lights up!
