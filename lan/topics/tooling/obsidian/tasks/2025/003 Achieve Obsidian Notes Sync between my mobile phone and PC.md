# 1 Objective

Previously, we have [[005 Designate Windows Laptop as backup server with bare git repo per content#3.1 Clone project in phone and try to open it with mobile obsidian|cloned an obsidian vault in mobile to have our notes on all devices]].

This solution is functional, however it would be good to also have seamless content sync between devices. We ran into an issue that terminal access in the phone with termux was quite limited without rooting. 

The goal here is to root our device or install an open source OS and achieve sshfs sync with the phone.
