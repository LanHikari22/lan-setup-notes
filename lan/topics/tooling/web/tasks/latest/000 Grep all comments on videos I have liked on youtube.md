# 1 Objective

Searching the stream of time is difficult. There is this one video from 5+ years I want to find, and all I have is tiny keyword memories. Searching youtube itself would be enormous. Searching my playlists and liked lists is enough.

I would like to

- [ ] Grep all the videos I liked by title and get the url.
- [ ] Grep all comments in said videos for keywords.
- [ ] Grep all comments in a specific video for keywords.
- [ ] Use it easy with a docker CLI interface. No installation, no fuss. Reproducible.
- [ ] Publish it for now under `delta-box`. A project of reproducible container projects. This could be `box000`.

I have done this before. I should see what I used in my prior scripts.
