Parent: [[000 Fix Windows Laptop not booting]]

Spawned from [[000 Laptop just gives black screen when trying to install OS via USB#^spawn-issue-0b45b0]]

# 1 Issue

When eventually the boot device selection window appears, my USB drive does not appear as an option.

I've tried multiple slots that should be functional.
